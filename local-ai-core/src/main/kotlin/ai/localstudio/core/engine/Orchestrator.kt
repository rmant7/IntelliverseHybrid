/**
 * The top-level entry point: request in, answer out.
 *
 * Deliberately thin, because every decision it needs has an owner already —
 * the router decides which capabilities are involved, [PipelineBuilder] turns
 * that into a graph, [ModelSelector] picks models per capability, the runtime
 * manager decides what stays in memory and the context engine decides what the
 * model sees. The orchestrator only sequences them.
 *
 * Chat and user-authored pipelines share one path: [handle] builds a graph and
 * runs it, [run] takes a graph that already exists. There is no second
 * execution path that can drift.
 *
 * Takes [engine] pre-built rather than a `NodeExecutors` to build it from:
 * `NodeExecutors` is what actually wires memory/knowledge retrieval into the
 * pipeline, and it — along with everything it needs from `:commercial-memory`
 * and the external Mobile_mem0 artifact — lives in the separate `:core-chat`
 * module specifically so `:core` itself never has to depend on either. A
 * caller that wants memory just builds its own `NodeExecutors` and passes
 * `PipelineEngine(executors.build())`; one with no use for it (translation,
 * or a future IntelliVerse caller wanting only cloud models) never needs
 * `:core-chat`, `:commercial-memory` or Mobile_mem0 on its classpath at all.
