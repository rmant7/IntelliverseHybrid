/**

 * reproducible shape this feeds into (device/app metadata is attached by
 * the caller, not here: this class has no Android dependency, deliberately,
 * the same reasoning the rest of `core` already follows).
 *
 * **One engine fully resident at a time, on purpose.** Each engine is
 * loaded, warmed up (see [TranscriptionEngine.load]/
 * [TranscriptionEngineSession.warmUp]), run against every file, and
 * released *before the next engine's own [TranscriptionEngine.load] call
 * starts* — never two engines' sessions held open at once. Comparing
 * several on-device model sizes (e.g. every installed Whisper size, from
 * Tiny to Large) is exactly this benchmark's own point; holding all of them
 * resident simultaneously would mean several hundred MB to multiple GB of
 * native weights (plus each one's own inference buffers) loaded at the same
 * time, on a phone already running everything else the user has open. This
 * is what real memory pressure during a multi-model run looks like — this
 * ordering is what avoids it, not just a nice-to-have.
 *
 * Per-file results across engines still land in the same order every file
 * was scanned in ([BenchmarkFileResult] per file, holding one
 * [BenchmarkRunMetrics] per engine) — callers do not see or need to care
 * that engines were processed one at a time internally.
 *
 * **A failed load or warm-up does not abort the run**: that engine's rows
 * simply report [BenchmarkStatus.ERROR] for every file rather than
 * silently vanishing from a report someone will read weeks later trying to
 * understand why a backend is "missing." The one exception is
 * [CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_ABORT_THRESHOLD]: too many failures in a row, across
 * engine boundaries, is no longer "this backend is missing" but "something
 * outside this app is broken," and grinding through the rest of the run at
 * that point produces hours of guaranteed failures, not data — see that
 * constant's own doc comment for the real device report behind it.
