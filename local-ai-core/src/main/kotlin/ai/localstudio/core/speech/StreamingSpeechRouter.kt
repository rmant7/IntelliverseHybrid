 * dispatch to *several* models over its lifetime as the detected language

 * non-suspend, buffer-only contract) because the router does real
 * asynchronous work — LID, model selection, a specialist's own
 * `acceptAudio` — but it must still return quickly: see
 * [DefaultStreamingRoutingSession]'s own doc comment for how audio capture
 * stays decoupled from that work through internal, bounded buffering rather
 * than this call itself blocking on it.
