/**
 * Picks the file to download out of everything a model repository offers.
 *
 * Quantized-model repos are restructured by their maintainers on a timescale of
 * weeks: file names change, offered quant levels change, sometimes the canonical
 * repo for a family changes. A file name baked into the catalog at build time is
 * therefore wrong within months, which is why [ModelDescriptor] pins a *family*
 * and the concrete artifact is resolved at browse time.
 *
 * The ranking is pure and separated from any network call, because this is the
 * part most likely to need tuning as new naming conventions turn up.
 *
 * Note for whoever writes the HTTP layer: on Hugging Face the real byte size of
 * a large file lives under `lfs.size`, while the top-level `size` is the size of
 * the LFS pointer. Reading the wrong one produces a catalog full of 130-byte
 * models.
