 * Loads a GGUF as an embedding model rather than a chat model: the context is

 * to nativeLoad: this repo's chat-generation path and a one-shot embedding
 * session share nothing beyond both loading a GGUF, and every existing
 * nativeLoad call site is untouched by adding this instead of changing it.
 *
 * [pooling] is a caller-supplied `llama_pooling_type` ordinal (1=MEAN,
 * 2=CLS, 3=LAST — matching llama.h's own enum values) rather than hardcoded:
 * different embedding checkpoints are trained expecting different pooling
 * (e5-family models want mean pooling; others want the CLS token), and
 * using the wrong one for a given model does not error — it silently
 * produces vectors that still look valid while retrieval quality quietly
 * degrades, exactly the failure mode hardest to notice without a real model
 * to test against. An unrecognized value falls back to MEAN rather than
 * failing the whole load, since it is far more likely to be a caller bug
 * (or a not-yet-updated caller) than a deliberate, unsupported choice.
 *
 * The batch/context size is deliberately capped far below nativeLoad's chat
 * ceiling: embedding inputs here are one memory fact or one query, never a
 * resent multi-turn conversation, and llama.cpp requires n_batch == n_ubatch
 * for a non-causal model (see the upstream embedding example) — both sized
 * to n_ctx up front, so every call in nativeEmbed fits in one llama_decode
 * with no chunking logic to get wrong.
